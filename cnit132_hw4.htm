  <h1>Ralston Intermediate School</h1>

<p>Ralston Intermediate School serves all sixth through eighth grade students in the Belmont/Redwood Shores School District. During the 2014-2015 school year we anticipate an enrollment of approximately 1175  students. The Ralston staff provides our students with a strong Common Core State Standards based academic program.</p>

<p>Every Ralston student receives  instruction in the core subjects of language arts, history/social  science, mathematics, science, physical education and health education.  All students may select from a wide variety of elective classes.</p>

<p> Ralston students have the opportunity to participate in numerous  extra-curricular activities. A comprehensive after-school sports  program supported by School-Force provides team sports experiences in  golf, basketball, cross-country, volleyball, tennis, and track and  field. After school tutorial classes and homework groups are available  several days per week for all grades. The PTA sponsors a diverse selection of clubs based on student and teacher interest. The clubs meet after school and are offered for a minimal fee. Our student body has an active student government, which sponsors spirit days, dances and other school wide activities.</p>
